# caqui-chatbot

Monorepo Yarn workspaces: `apps/api` (Fastify), `apps/web` (Vite/React), `packages/shared` (Zod schemas/types). Each app has its own `CLAUDE.md` with details; this file holds only what applies everywhere.

## Recommended workflows (project skills)

This project ships two skills in `.claude/skills/`. They hold flows that were validated end to end, so following them is strongly recommended over improvising. You can adapt a step when the situation calls for it; say so in your report.

- **`implement-spec`** (`/implement-spec <name>`): implement a spec from `docs/specs/`, run the project and prove every acceptance criterion with a test. Use it also when the user asks in plain words ("implement the XPTO spec, run it and test it").
- **`new-endpoint`** (`/new-endpoint <feature> <METHOD /route>`): add an API endpoint with a complete OpenAPI contract.

If a skill is not available in your session, read its file at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and follow the steps.

| `yarn db:generate` / `db:migrate` / `db:seed` | Drizzle migrations and seed                                                              |
| `yarn dev:logged`                             | Hybrid mode: apps on the host, output copied to `.logs/dev.log`                          |

## Running environment (runbook)

1. Run `yarn status`. If everything is healthy, do nothing else.
2. If not, run `yarn setup` (on a fresh clone with no `node_modules` use `yarn install && yarn setup`). Wait on healthchecks, never `sleep`.
3. Test user: credentials of the seed in `.env.example` (`SEED_USER_EMAIL` / `SEED_USER_PASSWORD`).

## Logs and the user's terminal

The user usually keeps the stack running in their own terminal, which you cannot read. Do not start a second instance.

- Docker mode: `docker compose logs --since 5m api` (or `web`, `migrate`); follow with `docker compose logs -f --tail 100 api`.
- Hybrid mode: `tail -n 200 .logs/dev.log`.
- When investigating a bug, a 500 or an e2e failure, read the logs before guessing from the code.
- Only start the environment yourself if `yarn status` shows it is stopped, and tell the user.

## Working from specs

Specs live in `docs/specs/<name>.md` (copy `_template.md`): goal, context, endpoints, user flows, acceptance criteria, out of scope. Every acceptance criterion becomes a test: business rules and API in Vitest, user flows in Playwright. Implement them with the `implement-spec` skill (see "Recommended workflows"). On finishing, report criterion by criterion what was validated and how.

## Rules

- **Any change to a user flow must be validated with Playwright**: create or update the e2e test and run it before calling the task done.
- **Any UI change must also be looked at**: run `yarn e2e layout` and inspect the screenshots (details in `apps/web/CLAUDE.md`, "Visual check").
- TypeScript is always `strict`. No `any`, no `@ts-ignore`, promises always awaited or handled. Do not loosen `tsconfig` or ESLint rules to make a check pass; fix the cause.
- Zod is the single source of truth for validation, types and OpenAPI.
- Commits follow Conventional Commits: `feat(api): ...`, `fix(web): ...`, `chore: ...`. Hooks (husky + lint-staged) run ESLint and Prettier on staged files.
- Env vars are read only through `apps/api/src/env.ts` (api) and `import.meta.env.VITE_*` (web).

## Pitfalls (do not)

- Edit `apps/api/openapi.json` by hand (generated by `yarn api:openapi`).
- Edit a migration that was already applied (create a new one).
- Add a dependency without asking the user.
- Disable a lint rule, relax `strict`, or use `any` to get checks passing.
- Read `process.env` outside `env.ts`.
- Commit `.env` or anything under `.logs/`.
- Start a second copy of the environment.
